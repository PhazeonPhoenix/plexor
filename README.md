The evolution of dotfiles. This is my new combined configuration for several
linux apps to work in concert. It's based heavilly on the Solarized color 
scheme for as many items as possible and designed to be drop in usable for
many purposes. It's only been tested on Arch Linux so your milage may vary.

## Required Apps ##

Just install any missing apps. 

* tmux
* vim
* bash
* dircolors
* git
* A good terminal such as PuTTY for Windows and any xterm derivative on Linux.

## Optional ##

* multitail
* htop

## Installation ##

Simple. Clone and run ./install.sh.

**WARNING** This WILL overwrite already existing configs. You have been warned.

## Configure your terminal ##

To completely experience this colorscheme you need to configure your terminal
with the solarized color pallet. I've included the reg file for PuTTY.
